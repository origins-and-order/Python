# Pyfiles
These are some of the files I thought were interesting. 
These are the files I worked/messed on during my undergrad at [The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley](http://www.utrgv.edu/).
I hope these scripts provide some insight to the Python language. 
I've enjoyed using Python for most of my undergrad career for various assignments and tool creations.
Enjoy.
